## Portfolio Enhancement - Remaining Pages to Create

I've successfully created:
✅ `/projects` page - Comprehensive case studies for all projects
✅ `/advanced-features` page - Week 7 optimizations and caching
✅ Updated navigation with links to new pages

### Still Need to Create:

Due to response length limits, here are the remaining pages you need. I'll provide the structure:

#### 1. `/optimization` Page (Week 7)
- Query processing improvements
- Before/after performance comparisons  
- Benchmarking results
- Algorithm optimizations

#### 2. `/monitoring` Page (Week 8)
- Live performance metrics dashboard
- Real-time API response times
- Error tracking
- Usage statistics

#### 3. `/scalability` Page (Week 8)
- Load testing results
- Horizontal scaling strategies
- Database optimization
- CDN integration

#### 4. `/operations` Page (Week 8)
- Production maintenance procedures
- Deployment guide
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring alerts

#### 5. `/mcp-integration` Page
- MCP tool calling demonstrations
- Integration examples
- API documentation
- Code snippets

#### 6. `/demo` Page
- Interactive Digital Twin demo
- Live chatbot testing
- Response quality examples
- Feature showcase

#### 7. `/professional` Page
- Branding guidelines
- Color palette
- Typography system
- Component library

### Quick Start:

**Currently Running:**
- ✅ Projects page: http://localhost:3001/projects
- ✅ Advanced Features: http://localhost:3001/advanced-features

**Would you like me to continue creating the remaining pages?** I can create them in batches or you can let me know which ones are highest priority.

### Alternative Approach:
Since you have many pages to build, I can:
1. Create simplified versions of all pages quickly
2. OR focus on the most important 3-4 pages with full detail
3. OR provide templates you can customize

Let me know how you'd like to proceed! 🚀
